Simple Fault-tolerant File System, version 1

This tiny filesystem was designed to be the most safe in a world of one-byte 
unbuffered serial write to NVRAM. Writing into such NVRAM splitted into 
single-byte commands and could be interrupted at any single byte without losing
your precious data.

Also this filesystem will protect you from NVRAM wearing. It saves timestamps
of writes and always rotate files around the flash, so you never got the same
file written again and again on the same place.

This was quite an interesting experience and I hope you'll find it useful.
