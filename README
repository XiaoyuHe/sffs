Simple Fault-tolerant File System, version 1

This tiny filesystem was designed to be the most safe in a world of one-byte 
unbuffered serial write to NVRAM. Writing into such NVRAM meant to be 
unbuffered and could be interrupted at any single byte without losing
your precious data.

This was quite an interesting experience and I hope you'll find it useful.
